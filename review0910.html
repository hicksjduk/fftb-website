<h1>Annual Review - 2009/10</h1>
<p>It has been another good year in the life of the group,
culminating in the successful renewal of the Borough's Fairtrade status,
which was obtained in April. This is great news. The <a
	href="http://fairtrade.org.uk">Fairtrade Foundation</a> was very
complimentary about the work that we do and the progress we have made.
We will next have to renew in the spring of 2012.</p>
<p>Our work with the <a href="http://www.fareham.gov.uk">Borough
Council</a> was given a boost this year by the support we received from
council leader Cllr Se&aacute;n Woodward. The Council now has an
official representative on the working group, Cllr Pam Bryant, whose
presence is already proving very useful and positive. We were invited to
have a Fairtrade stand at all six of the Summer 2010 Community Action
Team meetings across the borough, which have been fruitful in reaching
more people with the message of Fairtrade. The Hampshire County
Councillors representing Fareham have also been very supportive.</p>
<p>The year has seen a big increase in the number and range of
Fairtrade products which are available in shops throughout the borough.
To a large extent this is due to major brands, and big retailers' own
brands, becoming Fairtrade: for example four-finger Kit Kats and
Sainsbury's Red Label tea. And it's not just food: more and more clothes
retailers are turning to Fairtrade cotton, and Fairtrade cosmetics and
other beauty products are starting to become available. However, there
is still room for individuals and groups to put pressure on their local
store to stock more Fairtrade items; so please keep doing so!</p>
<p>We have received great support from the <a
	href="http://www.thesouthernco-operative.co.uk/">Southern
Co-Operative Group</a>, which is based in Fareham. They have been generous
with vouchers to enable us to offer free Fairtrade samples at our
events, and also <jdh:pageLink pageID="coopgrant">gave us a grant of &pound;655</jdh:pageLink>
to buy a set of display boards.</p>
<p>We have continued our extensive work with schools, running
assemblies and workshops, and helping teachers to work Fairtrade into
the curriculum. We have also given talks to various community groups. We
are always glad to do more of these, so if your school or community
group would like us to come along please <jdh:mailTo id="chair"
	desc="Rachel Hicks">contact me</jdh:mailTo>. Faith groups throughout
the borough also continue to support Fairtrade in a big way: mostly
these are churches, although we have also made good links with the local
Muslim congregation.</p>
<p>Fairtrade Fortnight, in late February and early March, was most
successful, with a variety of displays and stalls. <jdh:pageLink
	pageID="ftf10stall">Our main stall</jdh:pageLink>, in <a
	href="http://www.farehamshopping.com/">Fareham Shopping Centre</a>, was
supported by the Mayor of Fareham, the leader of the council, and <a
	href="http://www.markhoban.com">Mark Hoban MP</a>, and attracted a lot
of interest. We also sold a number of our unique Fairtrade cotton
shopping bags, proclaiming that Fareham is a Fairtrade Borough&nbsp;-
these are still available, priced at a very reasonable &pound;2.</p>
<p>We have enjoyed increasingly close co-operation with other local
Fairtrade groups. We attended events in Gosport, Eastleigh and
Winchester, and together with several local groups we hosted a visit by
Vinay Devaiah, a Fairtrade tea producer from India, who was able to
share first-hand experience of the difference Fairtrade makes where it
matters&nbsp;- in poor communities in the developing world.</p>
<p>When you buy Fairtrade, you are making a real difference. You are
enabling people who have very little to earn a living, invest in their
community, and take a big step out of poverty and into a fulfilled and
dignified life. Thank you for your support.</p>
