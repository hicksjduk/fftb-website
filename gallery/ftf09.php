<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2009</h1>
<p>Fairtrade Fortnight was exceptionally busy this year! As well as
our regular stall in Fareham Shopping Centre, we gave a presentation to
Fareham Borough Council, took part in a Fairtrade event at the Wicor
Co-Op, and held a Fairtrade tasting in our shop unit. There was also a
Fairtrade Festival at Locks Heath Free Church, which included the
creation and then eating of a gigantic banana split!</p>
<p>A selection of photographs from these events can be seen below;
