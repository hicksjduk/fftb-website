<h1>Fairtrade Celebration Meal - 7th March 2013</h1>
<p>Catering students at Fareham College rose successfully to the
	challenge of Fairtrade as part of Fareham's celebrations of Fairtrade
	Fortnight. They had been set the task, by the Fairtrade campaign groups
	in Fareham and Gosport, of devising a three-course menu using as many
	Fairtrade ingredients as possible; and the best dishes were served to
	around 40 guests at a special dinner in the college's Chequers
	Restaurant.</p>
