<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2015</h1>
<p>We held a very successful stall in Fareham Shopping Centre on
	Saturday 28th February. We were pleased to welcome the Mayor and Mayoress of
	Fareham, Cllr David and Mrs Pamela Norris.</p>
<p>We gave away samples of various Fairtrade goods, including
	bananas that had been kindly donated by the Co-Op store on Gudge Heath
	Lane.</p>
