<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2008</h1>
<p>We held a highly successful event for Fairtrade Fortnight 2008 in
Fareham Shopping Centre. We also had displays in Portchester and Locks
Heath libraries, and several churches in the town held Fairtrade sales
to coincide with the Fortnight.</p>
<p>A selection of photographs from the event can be seen below;
