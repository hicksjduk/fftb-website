<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2012</h1>
<p>We held a very successful stall in the Fareham Farmers' Market on
	Saturday 3rd March. We were pleased to welcome the Mayor and Mayoress
	of Fareham, Cllr Trevor and Mrs Ruth Cartwright, and other members of
	the Borough Council including the Leader, Cllr Se&aacute;n Woodward,
	and also Fareham's MP Mark Hoban.</p>
<p>With the theme of this year's Fortnight being "Take a Step", we
	invited passers-by to colour in a footprint as an expression of their
	commitment to Fairtrade.</p>
<p>A selection of photographs from this event can be seen below; click
	on a small picture to see a larger version.</p>
