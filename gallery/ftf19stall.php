<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2019</h1>
<p>We held a very successful stall in Fareham Shopping Centre on
	Saturday 2nd March, which this year featured work on Fairtrade by Year 4 pupils at Locks Heath Junior School.
	We were pleased to welcome the Mayor of
	Fareham, Cllr Susan Bayford, and other members of the Borough Council.</p>
