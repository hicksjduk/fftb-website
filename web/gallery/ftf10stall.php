<p>We held a very successful stall in Fareham Shopping Centre on
	Saturday 20th February. We were pleased to welcome the Mayor of
	Fareham, Cllr Ruth Godrich, and other members of the Borough Council
	including the Leader, Cllr Se&aacute;n Woodward. We appreciated the
	support of the Co-Op, Sainsburys and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of whom
	gave us or lent us goods for our display.</p>
