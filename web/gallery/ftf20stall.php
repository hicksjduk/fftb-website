<h1>Fairtrade Fortnight 2020</h1>
<p>We held a very successful stall in Fareham Shopping Centre on
	Saturday 29th February, which this year featured work on Fairtrade by pupils at Redlands Primary School,
	and some Fairtrade roses (for Leap Year Day!).
	We were pleased to welcome the Mayor of
	Fareham, Cllr Pam Bryant, and other members of the Borough Council.</p>
