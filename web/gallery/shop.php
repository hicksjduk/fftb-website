<h1>Shop in Fareham Shopping Centre</h1>
<p>During 2008 and 2009, we had a short-term lease on a shop unit,
jointly with <a href="http://thefarehamwell.co.uk">The Well</a>. It was
staffed by volunteers drawn from the Fairtrade Borough working group and
The Well. A selection of photographs of the shop can be seen below;
