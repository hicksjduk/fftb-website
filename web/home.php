<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
	We are the local steering group for Fairtrade in the Borough of
	Fareham, Hampshire - one of over 400 groups registered with the <a
		href="http://www.fairtrade.org.uk">Fairtrade Foundation</a> under the
	Fairtrade Towns initiative. Our objective is to promote Fairtrade in
	Fareham, to encourage more people to buy Fairtrade goods, and more
	retailers and catering establishments to sell them. Fareham has been a
	Fairtrade Borough, fulfilling the five criteria to be recognised as a
	Fairtrade Town, since 2007.

	Fairtrade goods are those which carry the Fairtrade Mark (left), which
	is an independent and internationally-recognised guarantee that:
<ul>
	<li>the producer of the goods receives a fair price that covers the
		costs of sustainable production;
	
	<li>a premium is paid that can be invested in development;
	
	<li>the goods are supplied under contracts that allow for long-term
		planning and sustainable production practices;
	
	<li>workers are treated decently and paid a living wage;
	
	<li>basic health and safety and environmental standards are met;
	
	<li>no forced or child labour is used.

</ul>
</div>
<p>Buying Fairtrade goods is an easy and effective way for UK consumers
	to make a real, positive difference in the lives of people in the
	developing world. A wide and increasing range of Fairtrade goods is
	available in a growing number of retail outlets, and their quality and
	price compares very favourably with non-Fairtrade equivalents.
	Fairtrade is an essential tool for enabling poor communities to trade
	their way out of poverty.
